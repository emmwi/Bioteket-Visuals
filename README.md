# Bioteket-Visuals 🌸
## This repo is made to show the visuals of the Bi-O-Teket 

This is a webbapplication made for beekepers-
It's a system that helps beekeepers keep track of the apiaries they own and how things are looking in the different beehives they have in the apiaries. 

🚀 Tech stack for project:

## How it works🐝
A beekeper can:

📌 Make an account
  - Username, password and e-mail can be changed by user. Account can also be deleted by user.

🏡 Add one or more Apiaries.
  - Name and adress of Apiary can be edited. Apiaries can also be deleted

🍯 Add beehives to apiary
  - The name given to the box can be edited, hives can be put into archive if not activly used. They can be reactived and they can also be deleted

📦 Add boxes to the different beehives
  - Boxes can be put into archive if not activly used. They can be reactived and they can also be deleted.

📖 Make notes and keep a journal for each apiary
  - These notes can be filtered on month an year to make it possible for the beekeper to compare notes from previous years for the same Apiary. 

🔍 Add inspections
  - These inspections can be edited, deleted and compared to previous inspections. 

## ✨During this development, I've had the opportunity to:

✔ Immerse myself in React and TypeScript, trying to put focus on scalable and maintainable code.

✔ Optimize performance by implementing efficient data fetching and state management.

✔ Design a structured API with Express and PostgreSQL, ensuring smooth data flow.

✔ Handle authentication securely using access tokens and refresh tokens.

✔ Improve error handling and debugging for a better developer experience.
