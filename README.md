# Bioteket-Visuals 🌸
## This repo is made to show the visuals of the Bi-O-Teket 

This is a webbapplication made for beekepers-
It's a system that helps beekeepers keep track of the apiaries they own and how things are looking in the different beehives they have in the apiaries.

## How it works🐝
A beekeper can:

📌 Make an account
  - Username, password and e-mail can be changed by user. Account can also be deleted by user.

🏡 Add one or more Apiaries.
  - Name and adress of Apiary can be edited. Apiaries can also be deleted

🍯 Add beehives to apiary
  - The name given to the box can be edited, hives can be put into archive if not activly used. They can be reactived and they can also be deleted

📦 Add boxes to the different beehives
  - Boxes can be put into archive if not activly used. They can be reactived and they can also be deleted.

📖 Make notes and keep a journal for each apiary
  - These notes can be filtered on month an year to make it possible for the beekeper to compare notes from previous years for the same Apiary. 

🔍 Add inspections
  - These inspections can be edited, deleted and compared to previous inspections.

🍯 Add honey harvest
  - User can add the harvest of honey for specific date as well as for beehive, kg added this year will be shown on overview of each beehive as well as apiary. This feature is also currently not done and under development.

## ✨During this development, I've had the opportunity to:

✔ Immerse myself in React and TypeScript, trying to put focus on scalable and maintainable code.

✔ Optimize performance by implementing efficient data fetching and state management.

✔ Design a structured API with Express and PostgreSQL, ensuring smooth data flow.

✔ Handle authentication securely using access tokens and refresh tokens.

✔ Improve error handling and debugging for a better developer experience.
